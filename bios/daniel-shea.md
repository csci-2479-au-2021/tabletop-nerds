## My Information

Hey Everyone,
My name is Daniel Shea, I am a Computer Science Web Developer track major at Columbus State. 
I am interested in web development because I have a fascination with technology and I really enjoy working on websites and web applications. 
I plan to graduate after this semester with my associates, and I will hopefully find a job as a web developer soon after. Lastly, when I am not working, 
I enjoy getting take-out with my girlfriend, being active with my dog, playing videogames, and DJing.
