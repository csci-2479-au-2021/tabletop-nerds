## Sarah Sheets / Web Dev Track

#### My interest in web dev began prior to school age. Rather than playing the games offered, I found myself exploring Windows security settings and file systems on a shared desktop at my daycare, much to the dismay of staff. The logic of code is really what pulled me in more as I grew older, I felt it was a wonderful thing that given a set of proper instructions, the system will execute, and hey, if you're wrong, it's usually easy to fix. It always makes sense, I suppose, and maybe that's something I latched onto, because like math, I could always find a solution or answer of some sort.

#### After graduation is blurry for me, honestly, I've shifted lanes and gears over time. I forsee myself working with development or databases at some point in the near future, building and debugging are both fun to me. I'd also like to complete and publish a site for my LLC in order to expand that realm further as well.

#### When I'm not working... my time is still ususally filled haha. I'm with my niece and dogs a bit, playing in our yard, swimming, or finding a new playground with a bigger slide for her to try. I spend time cooking, running, having deep thought inducing conversations, driving, learning new things, enjoying nature, supporting movements in favor of a fair market (AMC100K!), and listening to music, preferably at a high volumes.
